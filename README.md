Thanks for checking out this app.

Cockatoo is a simple recorder app that can be used to record all sounds for later use or analysis
It's good for students who want to record lectures in class and playback later for studying
It's also good to remind yourself of things to buy at grocery store
Last but not least, it can help you do your work like house investigating, company demo, training or presentation.

Of course this app cannot replace the normal digital recorder due to its limitation such as memory and battery, 
but it proves to be handy in some scenario and a decent alternative solution.

I wrote this app for experiment purpose, not because I want to sell it or sell advertising. So, maintaining and support 
might be limited. Also, using recorder might violate privacy, so use with care.
